# Water Sort Puzzle Solver

## Introduction

This project implements a search agent that solves the water sort puzzle. The puzzle consists of several bottles, each filled with different layers of colored liquids. The objective is to rearrange the liquids so that all layers in each bottle are of the same color. The agent achieves this by pouring from one bottle to another, subject to certain conditions.

### Project Features
- Implements multiple search strategies:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Iterative Deepening Search (ID)
  - Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
  - Greedy Search with two heuristics
  - A* Search with two heuristics
